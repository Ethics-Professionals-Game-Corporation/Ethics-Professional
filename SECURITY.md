# Security Policy

Ethics Professionals Game Corporation GitHub Security Policy

**Purpose**

This policy establishes guidelines for secure development practices and the responsible use of GitHub within the Ethics Professionals Game Corporation (EPGC).  The policy aims to:

* Protect EPGC's intellectual property and sensitive data.
* Maintain the integrity and confidentiality of code repositories.
* Prevent unauthorized access and modification to code and data.
* Ensure compliance with relevant industry standards and regulations.

**Scope**

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have access to or use EPGC's GitHub repositories for development purposes.

**Responsibilities**

* **Development Team:** Responsible for adhering to secure coding practices, implementing security measures within code, and promptly reporting any security concerns.
* **Security Team:** Oversees security policy enforcement, conducts regular vulnerability scans, and provides security training to employees.
* **IT Department:** Manages user accounts, access permissions, and the technical infrastructure supporting GitHub usage.
* **Management:** Has ultimate responsibility for ensuring compliance with this policy and ensuring resources are allocated towards security efforts.

**Policy Guidelines**

**1. Account Management**

* **Strong Passwords:** All GitHub accounts must use strong, unique passwords that conform to company password complexity standards. Passwords must be changed regularly.
* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** MFA is required for all EPGC GitHub accounts.
* **Access Control:** The principle of least privilege will be applied.  User access to repositories should be granted based on job function and the minimum permissions necessary.
* **Account Termination:** GitHub accounts of departing employees must be deactivated immediately.

**2. Repository Security**

* **Visibility:** Repositories containing sensitive data or code must be marked as "private."
* **Branch Protection:** Critical branches (e.g., "main," "master") should be protected to require review and approval before merges.
* **Code Reviews:**  A mandatory code review process will be in place for all changes made to production repositories.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scheduled vulnerability scans of repositories will be implemented. Critical vulnerabilities must be addressed promptly.

**3. Secure Coding Practices**

* **Security Training:**  Developers will receive regular training on secure coding practices, such as those outlined in the OWASP Top 10.
* **Input Validation:** Input data must be strictly sanitized and validated to prevent injection attacks.
* **Error Handling:** Error messages should not reveal sensitive technical details that may be exploited.
* **Dependency Management:** Third-party libraries and components will be regularly vetted for known vulnerabilities and updated promptly.

**4. Incident Response**

* **Reporting:** Employees must immediately report suspected security breaches or unauthorized access to the Security Team.
* **Response Plan:** The Security Team will have a documented incident response plan outlining procedures for containment, investigation, and remediation.
* **Communication:** Stakeholders will be kept informed of any breaches in a timely and transparent manner, in accordance with applicable regulations. 

**5. Compliance and Auditing**

* **Compliance:** This policy will aim to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2, etc.).
* **Audits:**  Regular security audits of GitHub repositories and practices will be conducted.

**6. Policy Review and Updates**

This policy will be reviewed annually (or more frequently if needed) to reflect changes in technology, best practices, and EPGC's risk profile. 

**Enforcement**

Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

**Important Considerations**

* **Tailor this policy:** Adapt it further based on your specific technologies, development workflows, and regulatory framework.
* **Collaboration:**  Involve development, security, and IT teams in creating and refining this policy for better adoption.
* **Awareness:** Ensure all employees with GitHub access understand and comply with this policy.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Before You Report**

* **Gather Details:** Document the vulnerability clearly. Include:
    * Affected software or system (with version numbers)
    * Type of vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
    * Steps to reproduce the issue
    * Potential impact 
* **Proof of Concept (If Possible):** A simple demonstration of the vulnerability helps validate your report. Exercise caution if the exploit is dangerous.
* **Assess Severity:**  Try to understand the potential damage the vulnerability could cause. This helps prioritize the issue.

**How to Report**

1. **Find the Right Contact:**
   * **Security Page/security.txt:**  Check if the company or project has a dedicated security page, a `security.txt` file on their website, or a  `security@company.com` type email.
   * **Bug Bounty Programs:** Platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne facilitate vulnerability reporting to many companies.
   * **Vendor's Website:** Search for "vulnerability reporting" or "responsible disclosure" on the vendor's official website. 
   * **Public Disclosure:**  Consider this as a last resort if you get no response or there is an immediate risk to many users. Be very careful not to expose sensitive details unnecessarily.

2. **Provide Essential Information:**
   * **Vulnerability Details:**  Describe the vulnerability as clearly as possible, with steps to reproduce.
   * **Impact:** Explain the potential risks and how it might be exploited.
   * **Your Contact Information:** This allows the team to follow up for clarification or coordinate fixes. Consider using an email not tied to your main personal accounts for added privacy.

3. **Be Patient and Respectful:** 
   * Allow reasonable time for the vendor to respond, investigate, and develop a fix.
   * Communicate professionally. Avoid threats or pressure tactics.
   *  Coordinate with the vendor on disclosing the issue publicly, especially if it's a high-risk vulnerability.

**Important Considerations**

* **Act Responsibly:** Never exploit the vulnerability for personal gain or to cause harm.
* **Understand Rewards:** Some companies offer financial rewards or recognition for finding vulnerabilities. Check if this applies.
* **Public Disclosure:** If the vendor is unresponsive or doesn't address the vulnerability in a timely manner, you might consider responsible public disclosure to protect users. However, do this ethically and with caution.

**Example Template**

You can adapt something like this for your report:

```
